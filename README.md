# JSONGrapherExamples
Example files for JSON Grapher (www.jsongrapher.com)

It is best to copy the example files into a fresh directory to ensure they are outside of the zip directory. They must be outside of the zip directory to work with JSONGrapher. 

ExampleDataRecords includes example JSON Records of data that can be plotted in JSONGrapher, sorted by subdirectories.

ExampleModelRecords includes example JSON records which only have model inputs that can be used to simulate data which will then be plotted by JSONGrapher

ExampleSimulators includes a javascript model that can be called from JSONGrapher to execute a simple simulation. More examples may be added in the future.
